DBMS on public cloud saves valuable local computing resources. It is easy to create, use and file a query. 
I believe it also allows us to colloborate on projects via remote access. 
However, computing power is somewhat limit due our access plan.
I think the idea of offering DBMS in public cloud is the upcoming trend, many comany or indiviuals does not have the resourses
to manage their own data server, cloud computing offers by the big names is one of the best solution.
